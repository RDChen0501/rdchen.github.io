abstract: Probabilistic Simple Temporal Networks (PSTN) facilitate solving many interesting
  scheduling problems by characterizing uncertain task durations with unbounded probabilistic
  distributions. However, most current approaches assess PSTN performance using normal
  or uniform distributions of temporal uncertainty. This paper explores how well such
  approaches extend to families of non-symmetric distributions shown to better represent
  the temporal uncertainty introduced by, e.g., human teammates by building new PSTN
  benchmarks. We also build probability-aware variations of current approaches that
  are more reactive to the shape of the underlying distributions. We empirically evaluate
  the original and modified approaches over well-established PSTN datasets. Our results
  demonstrate that alignment between the planning model and reality significantly
  impacts performance. While our ideas for augmenting existing algorithms to better
  account for human-style uncertainty yield only marginal gains, our results surprisingly
  demonstrate that existing methods handle positively-skewed temporal uncertainty
  better.
